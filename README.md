# Otsu (between class variance) method
Otsu method (Otsu, 1979) is a nonparametric and unsupervised automatic threshold selection technique. It selects optimum
thresholds by maximizing between class variance of the segmented
classes. Let there be m number of thresholds [t1,t2, ...,tm] to be selected. These thresholds subdivide the image into m+1 classes: C0,
C1, C2,â€¦, Cm by maximizing the objective function.
